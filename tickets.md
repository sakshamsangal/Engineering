## Test case 
``` text
Hi
There are some hidden test cases which might be failing, these are apart from the sample test cases against which you verify your code in the DoSelect coding console. The hidden test cases are executed only when you submit.

These are non-sample test cases designed to check the logic of the code. Since this is a graded question, we won't be able to share with you the failed test cases before the deadline. Request you to please check your code for edge cases.

Testcase #3 (weight: 1)

Testcase #4 (weight: 1)

Hi Namratha, 
Please make sure that you have completed all the components of the segments. The components here include the videos, content, video questions, MCQ questions, open text questions, and coding questions.

## Issue Resolved
``` text
We're sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. This issue is now resolved. We request you to kindly re-login and check now, this should work fine. There are no penalties that are applied.
In case if this happens again, we would request you to wait 10 minutes before raising a ticket as this issue with the DoSelect segment progress gets auto-resolved within that time.  Doselect is a worldwide used platform and due to server load it might get delayed sometimes.

## Code rejected
``` text
Hi
When your code is verified correctly it means that it has passed the sample test cases. But when it is rejected after submission it means that there are a few hidden non-sample test cases which your code is not passing. One reason could be that you're hardcoding the solution using the exact values given in the example. Try writing a generic code that will pass all the test cases.

And if after first submission your answer is partially correct/rejected then there is button details besides partially correct/rejected after clicking on that you can find which test cases are failed for that particular program, so you can ask for the test cases, we will provide you with the test cases than after that what can you do is this give that input in the input tab and RUN your code instead of verifying it, because if after giving your input if you will click on verify button it will automatically take sample input, so request you to click on RUN button and check the Output, match it with the expected output then you will realize what is wrong with your code.
```

## Output format mismatch
``` text
Hi
Logic wise maybe your code is perfectly fine, but I will tell you how coding console works it will check for each and every word of your solution output with the expected output even spaces, lower case, uppercase, and even a small dot, if your solution Output does not match with the expected output it will reject the solution.

I would like to tell you one more thing which might help you, if you want to give your own input and check whether what is the Output, I would request you to give the input and RUN the code instead of verifying it, because if after giving your own input if you click on verify button then by default it will take sample input value, so RUN the code.

If your code satisfies all the above conditions but still it is getting rejected, Please share your code with us, I will check and let you know why it got rejected.

I just wanted to add that keep this motivation up throughout the program and let us know wherever you face an issue we are always there with you. Keep in constant touch with your student mentor if you feel low or demotivated, you are a part of upGrad family now.
